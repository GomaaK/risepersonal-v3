  var FOUNDER_NOTES = {
    sage: "I meet many people who know more than they say. You are one of them. A Sage earns trust by making hard things clear, and your answers show the depth to do it. Your job now is to think out loud in public: one idea a week, finished and shared. Nobody is waiting for perfect. They are waiting for you to say it.",
    creator: "You make things that did not exist before, and that is rare. A Creator's risk is the drawer full of almost-finished work. I have seen brilliant people stay unknown for years because they kept polishing. Your brand will grow the day you ship, show the process and let people watch you make. Done is the masterpiece your ideas are waiting for.",
    ruler: "People feel it when you walk into a room. A Ruler carries authority without raising a voice, and your answers say the same about you. The way to make that last is to share the stage. The leaders people remember are the ones who made others look good in public. Let your team and your partners be seen next to you.",
    hero: "You are built for proof: results, momentum, a record people can point to. That is a strong place to build a brand from. The risk for a Hero is running a sprint every day until the engine burns out. Pick a pace you can keep for years and let the results speak at that rhythm. A long campaign beats a brilliant sprint.",
    explorer: "You go where others are still reading about it. An Explorer's brand is a journey people want to follow, but a journey needs a home base. Share what you found, not only where you are going next. Bring the story back, in one place, on a schedule. People follow explorers who return with something for them.",
    magician: "You see around corners and make the impossible feel inevitable. That is a gift, and it is also the trap: ten brilliant ideas and no signature. A Magician's brand gets strong when you pick the one trick and master it in public. Choose your one transformation, name it and repeat it until people say it for you.",
    lover: "You make people feel valued, and you notice beauty where others miss it. That is a real advantage in building trust. A Lover's brand grows through discernment: say no beautifully, so every yes means more. Protect your standards and your energy. The people who matter will feel the difference, and so will the market.",
    jester: "You bring light into a room, and people remember how you made them feel. That is hard to teach and easy to underestimate. A Jester's next level is depth next to the humour: let them laugh, then let them think. When people can trust you with the serious thing as well as the funny one, your brand becomes unusual.",
    everyman: "You are the person people trust because you are real, and real is rare. Everyman brands do not need a costume, they need clarity. Your plain, honest way of saying things is your edge, so own it. Do not copy the polished voice you see everywhere. Say it the way you would say it to a friend and let it travel.",
    caregiver: "People feel safer with you in their corner, and your answers say you carry a lot for others. A Caregiver's brand is built on trust, but it only lasts if you are visible and have boundaries. You cannot pour from a brand that hides. Let people see what you do, and protect the time that keeps you steady.",
    innocent: "You bring clarity and honesty to a noisy market, and that calm is your brand. An Innocent often under-uses their voice, because quiet can feel like not enough. It is enough. It just deserves more volume. Say the simple true thing more often and more boldly, and people will lean in.",
    outlaw: "You break patterns so something better can take their place. People remember Outlaws, which is a great start. The next step is allies. Even revolutions need coalitions, and the Outlaws who last are the ones who found their people early. Aim the fire at one target, name it, and invite others to stand with you."
